### Problem Statement

Waste Management is one of the most pressing issues globally, significantly contributing to Global Warming and Climate Change. The improper handling of waste is a key factor, with the waste sector responsible for 10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to a [U.N article](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/environment-climate/cop27-unmanaged-waste.html). Open dumping accounts for 31% of these emissions, with lower-income countries relying on it for up to 93% of their waste disposal. Mismanaged waste often ends up in public ecosystems, illegal landfills, or is openly burned, exacerbating environmental and health issues. Effective recycling is essential to mitigate these problems, requiring the proper sorting of waste materials.

Leveraging the advancements in Computer Vision and Image Processing within Artificial Intelligence, this project aims to develop a neural network model to classify solid household waste into various categories. This technology can be further commercialized for use by waste management companies, potentially integrating with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for real-time waste monitoring. The project will enhance transparency in waste management systems by detecting and documenting waste details, including images and locations, accessible online. This system will alert municipalities and officials, compelling them to take timely and responsible action to manage and clean waste effectively.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Develop a Deep Learning Model:** Create a highly accurate neural network capable of classifying solid household waste into categories such as paper, cardboard, biological, metal, plastic, green glass, brown glass, white glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, and trash. If this is achieved, we will be addressing some SDG Goals including:

   - Goal 2: Zero Hunger 
   - Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
   - Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
   - Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
   - Goal 13: Climate Action
   - Goal 14: Life Below Water
   - Goal 15: Life on Land
   
2. **Enhance Recycling Techniques (SDG Goal 2):** Improve and optimize recycling processes to facilitate the production of fertilizers, benefiting farmers and contributing to ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture.

3. **Facilitate Waste Detection and Management:** Implement a system for efficient waste detection across various locations, ensuring timely and effective waste clearance and management by relevant authorities.

### Data Description
This dataset has 15,150 images from 12 different classes of household garbage; paper, cardboard, biological, metal, plastic, green-glass, brown-glass, white-glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, and trash.

The clothes category and 22 % of the shoes' category were obtained from the Clothing dataset https://www.kaggle.com/agrigorev/clothing-dataset-full
Around 29% of the other 9 classes combined was collected from the Garbage Classification dataset https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification
All the rest of the images were obtained using Web Scrapping.
All the images collected using web scrapping are owned by their original photographers/owners. The images are only used to promote research and is not used to generate any profit.
